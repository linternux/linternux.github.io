We can use it to mount a remote filesystem using the SSH Protocol.  So the information flowing between the two systems is completely encrypted. SSHFS is a client based application, so beside the SSH server, there is nothing to installed on the remote server to use it.  FUSE is a linux kernel module that allow non-privilege user to mount their own filesystem without the help of any kernel code. One of the interesting feature of SSHFS is that you can securely mount a filesystem over the internet, this is impossible with Samba and not very secure with NFS. If you like more information on SSHFS, you can visit the  <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html" title="Secure Shell Filesystem Home Page">SSHFS homepage</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSHFS" title="Secure Shell Filesystem Wiki ">Wiki</a> of the SSHFS package. There is also a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5BDkadiaZo" title="YouTube Video about SSHFS">YouTube video</a> that show how to use SSHFS on a Fedora system. For those interested in a windows version of sshfs, there is a free version available at the <a href="http://dokan-dev.net/en/">Dokan site</a>, you need to install the Dokan Library first, then install SSHFS. I have done some simple test with it and I didn’t had any problem.</p>
