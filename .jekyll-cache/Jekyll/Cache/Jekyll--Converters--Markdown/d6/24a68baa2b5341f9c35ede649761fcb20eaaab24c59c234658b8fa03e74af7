I"\<p>Today I would like to share with you, a little script that I use every week. I have four rewritable DVD that I use in rotation to backup important directories of my server at home. All I have to do is to leave one of these DVD+RW in the dvd drive and a backup of my important directories will be taken at regular interval. I have schedule a cron job that run tree times a week, to backup to DVD directories that are important to me. This is by no way a replacement of a full system backup like <a href="http://www.mondorescue.org/">Mondo rescue</a>, <a href="http://www.storix.com/">Storix</a> or <a href="http://www.acronis.com/enterprise/products/ATISLin/">Acronis</a>, but they represent to me the directories that are subject to change more often. I must specify that the command used in this <strong>script require using a DVD+RW to work</strong>.</p>
