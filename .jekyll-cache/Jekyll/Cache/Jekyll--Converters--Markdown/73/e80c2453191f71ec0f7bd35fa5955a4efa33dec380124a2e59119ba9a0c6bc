We will demonstrate some useful option of the command and how-to recover in some problematic situation. Keeping your system up to date is important, knowing how to do it and how to correct some issue related to rpm are also important. So let’s see if everyone can find something new about the “yum” command and see if we can apply it in our daily system admin job. You can also consult the <a href="http://yum.baseurl.org/" title="YUM Website">“yum” website</a> or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowdog_Updater,_Modified" title="YUM Wiki">“yum” wiki</a> to obtain more information. As always, I will try to make this article as useful as it can be, so we  can all come back to it and use it as a reference to the “yum” command.</p>
