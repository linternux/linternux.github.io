I"ã<p>We all know the ‚Äúhistory‚Äù command that display the list of commands you previously entered.¬† But have you ever wish to know when these commands were entered ?¬† This useful tip, will require only¬† a few seconds to put in place and will now add the date and time in your history file.<figure style="width: 479px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></figure></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" title="Usual history command output" src="http://linternux.com/images/history_command_figure_1.png" alt="Output of history command before the change to .bashrc" width="479" height="241" /> &lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Output of history command before the change to /etc/bashrc&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs modify our system global ‚Äúbashrc‚Äù file in /etc, so that the change affect every users using the system.<figure style="width: 537px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></figure></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" title="Adding date and time in our history file" src="http://linternux.com/images/modify_bashrc.png" alt="Defining HISTTIMEFORMAT variable in /etc/bashrc" width="537" height="137" /> &lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;Defining HISTTIMEFORMAT variable in /etc/bashrc&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Now, we need to log out and log back in the system to make our change effective.</strong><figure style="width: 509px" class="wp-caption alignnone"></figure></p>

<p><img loading="lazy" title="History command now show the date and time" src="http://linternux.com/images/history_command_figure_2.png" alt="History command now include the date &amp; time for each command" width="509" height="332" /> &lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text"&gt;History command now include the date &amp; time for each command&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</p>

<p>You will now notice,¬† the each command is preceded with a date and a time. Be aware, that all commands entered before our change to /etc/bashrc have been assigned the date and time we first login after doing the change.</p>

<p>So from now on every command we enter, will be recorded in .bash_history file with the date and time it was entered.</p>

<p>See you soon !</p>
