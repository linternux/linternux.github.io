I"F<p>As a system administrator, we must ensure that time synchronization is working at all time. Time synchronization have been proven to be helpful when we try to trace a chain of events that occurs on multiple servers or when trying to synchronize time sensitive-transactions. In this article, we will setup one NTP (Network Time Protocol) server running on RedHat/Centos 5, but it could be applied to the major Linux distribution.Â  As always, I have tried to make the article to be used a reference source, so that we can come back when ever you will play with the NTP tools.</p>
