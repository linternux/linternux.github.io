In this first article, we will mainly look at the configuration files. In the next article, we will look at some advance usage, that will help us in administrating our servers.  As always, will build our article, in a way that we can come back to it and use it as a reference if we need some information about “yum”. We will concentrate on the command line version of “yum”, but I would like mention that there is a graphical version called “yumex” that I would recommend. It is not the fastest one, but it is simple to use and it work.  Visit the  <a href="http://www.yum-extender.org/blog/" title="yumex home page">“yumex” home page</a>, you can aloso <a href="http://linternux.com/download/yumex/yumex-2.0.5-3.el5.noarch.rpm" title="Download yumex rpm">download the RedHat/Centos 5 rpm</a> from here.</p>
