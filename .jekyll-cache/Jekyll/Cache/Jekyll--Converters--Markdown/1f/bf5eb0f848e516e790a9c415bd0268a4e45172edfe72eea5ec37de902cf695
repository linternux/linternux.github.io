I"Q<p>When administrating a lot of Unix servers, there are some situation when you need to run a script from one server to another without entering a password. For example, let’s say that you need to take a cold backup of a Oracle database, but before starting it, you need to stop the application running on another server. In your Oracle backup script, you could “ssh” to application server and run a script that would stop the application before starting the backup.  But to do that with a script, you need a way to log on the application server without having to enter a password.</p>
